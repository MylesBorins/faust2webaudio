##faust2webaudio

So this is a test for right now of compiling noise.dsp to a c++ file that will compile with emscripten to asm.js.

Once that compilation process is working the faust functions will be used to generate sound with the web audio api.

Flocking Unit Generators and Synth Def's should also be able to be generated from the same source
