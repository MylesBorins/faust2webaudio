##about

This project utilizes that latest version of Faust (0.9.67) and the emscripten sdk (with fast-comp).

Once that compilation process is working the faust functions will be used to generate sound with the web audio api.

##TODO
Currently there are a couple of issues with this compiler that need to be done

* Implement generic build script
* Solve issue involving linking so each ugen does not need to have a complete instance of the emscripten vm
that.setupModel and that.init
* Implement method to attach ugens to variables in the model to allow for more advanced signal flow (This might be able to be done directly with web audio API)
* Improve
